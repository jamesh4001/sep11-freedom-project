##### The Expo Preparations

This is my sixth blog entry coming to you from June 5th on a Monday excited to talk about my experiences on what has occurred the past few weeks. Throughout the whole sep11 year, all the juniors have been waiting for the expo. The expo is an event held once per grade and is meant to give light and opportunities to the students in order to help them receive recognition and acknowledgment for all that we students have been working on. Arriving at school on this day, I was nervous but more than that, I was excited to show off the project we had been working on for months. Once I arrived at school about 10 minutes early, I got to the cafeteria where the expo would take place and began to set up early. My teammates, Safe and Jaiden, also got to school on time and we had everything set up. Once we were fully settled in a corner table, we all began to realize, we were yet to decide on what our elevator pitch would be leading us into our first challenge...

##### The Elevator Pitch

Looking at each other seconds before the expo began, Safe, Jaiden, and I, were all rushing trying to find and mix all of our individual elevator pitches to create a great pitch. An elevator pitch is a quick phrase that you use in order to quickly inform the viewers or audience about what you are showing to them. This is what makes, or breaks your presentation. An elevator pitch is important because it is what is typically used in order to hook the audience. Unfortunately for us, our original plan did not work. Because of us having completely different elevator pitches, we needed to rely on each of our takeaways. I showed Safe and Jaiden my pitch and explained how we could use it as a base for the pitch however, we would need to renovate it into a more professional pitch. Mr. Meuller's takeaways on my pitch and his feedback really saved us and allowed up to understand what we had to use to hook the readers. This made us set and allowed us to have our elevator pitch right before the expo could begin.


##### Takeaways and Self-Reflection

After completing the expo, some of the greatest takeaways that we as a group received was that the most important part of your project, is your elevator pitch. We realized this because at first, barely any students were coming up to our projects because we were all the way at the back. After realizing this, we shifted our mentality and decided to have our game open for everyone to see and greet anyone that passes by to take a look at our product. After doing this, we gained more viewers and were having fun! most importantly, people loved our games and eventually, we created a crowd that attracted a ton of people and judges. Unfortunately, we were not able to present to all of the judges however, what matters most is being able to show our project to whoever wishes to see and play it. Overall, we had a great time and the biggest takeaway is to understand the people around you and to always find a way to surpass challenges.
