Deciding on what to make my freedom project about was a difficult task to accomplish. The first thing I did to find my topic was go to a job site with many different jobs and options to choose from. After a couple of minutes of searching I came across some jobs that I had an interest in, them being Agriculture (farming), Cooking (food & recipes), and Construction (building & creating). Now came the harder part, deciding between the three. I wanted to focus on something that the world needs and can be improved in. Cooking was a strong choice for me but I realized that before cooking comes agriculture. After debunking the pros and cons of Agriculture and Construction I noticed that construction is a harder, hands-on job, leaving space for improvement. Since then I have stuck with construction and finding ways to improve the building and creating.
