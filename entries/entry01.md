##### Deciding My Freedom Project Tool and Topic

Deciding on a topic and tool for a freedom project is very complex and open to different ideas. Hello, my name is James Hernandez and this year in SEP 11 (Software Engineering Programe: Grade 11) we are brought together and focusing on one main yearly project. Although we do not work on this yearly project in class everyday, all of our learning and ideas come together for this big project! I am very excited and the first thing that we have to do in order to get us started, is chosing a topic important to me individually and chosing a tool (programing languages) to begin shaping our progress.

The first thing i decide to do is choose my topic. The reason for doing this first is because without my topic, I cant begin! In addition to this, I believe that it is best to chose a topic and then decide a tool based off on what works best for your topic and what you want to make. Going into this project I already had planned on making some type of game that brings joy and fun to the focused audience and anyone else that want's to play!
