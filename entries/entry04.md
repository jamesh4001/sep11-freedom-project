##### My process learning my tool and creating the MVP

At this point where I am at now, Me and my group member's plan on what we will create for our Freedom Project has been somewhat established. Me and my teamates Safe and Jaiden have been communicating and have been trynig to fully dissect what out final result will come out to. So far we already know we will create some type of game but the meaning and actual story of out platform game is still in the making. We have come to a point where we know we want there to be levels, some type of competitiveness in the game, even if this competitiveness is with yourself based on highscores. Overall we already have put general idea and begining to learn and fully understand out tools is what we are working on at this point in the year.

What I began to learn was the base of my tool, Kaboom. I learned what needed to be set up in my code and how to set up my code. I learned about spites, essencially little images that you can use to play and have as your character, and also that there are many azpects to Kaboom that I am yet to explore. Although it may not seem like I have learned a lot and any new techniques, I learned the fundamentals and what I need to keep in mind when coding with Kaboom.
